description: Today, quirky or eccentric outsiders are often afforded a measure of
  tolerance or even respect. In the nineteenth century, however, these original thinkers
  were often regarded as dangerous crackpots and subjected to scorn -- or worse. John
  Kendrick Bangs' The Idiot follows the ups and downs of one such unfortunate fellow
  in a most amusing fashion.
